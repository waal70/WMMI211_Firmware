Screens for the Earth Listener:


Splash screen - displays Earth Listener logo and cycles lights
Boot screen - displays status of sensors
Config screen - displays settings
Overview screen: displays the summary of all sensors;
From top left to top right, to bottom left to bottom right:
eCO2, Temperature, Pressure
TVOC, Humidity, Lightning

Design decision:
One sensor has one View class.
As there also is an overview screen - Render will take an argument as to which value to present
When this value is 0 or non-existant: assume you want the overview.
This instead of a class per screen: it would mean two classes have knowledge of icons - which I'd rather
keep separated. Now, only the Environment class knows about the relevant icons.

Screen components that are more or less generic:
Crumb-component: indicates how many screens there are + currently selected
Menu-component: play button for slideshow and cog-wheel for settings
